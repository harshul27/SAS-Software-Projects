# SAS Projects Repository

This repository features advanced SAS and SAS VIYA projects from my Master’s studies in Data Science & Statistics at UTD, showcasing expertise in analytics, statistics, and machine learning for institutional research and reporting.

## Highlights

- Automated SAS-based ETL pipelines for academic and compliance datasets.
- Built linear, logistic, GBM, clustering, and time series models examining retention, faculty KPIs, and enrollment forecasting.
- Developed interactive BI dashboards and summary reports with SAS Visual Analytics for technical/non-technical audiences.
- Integrated SAS with SQL, Python, and Power BI for cross-platform data extraction, processing, and visualization.
- Applied curriculum concepts: Advanced Statistical Methods, Machine Learning, Bayesian Data Analysis, and Applied Multivariate Analysis on real institutional datasets.

## Structure

- `/datasets`  
  Datasets used for academic assessment, enrollment analytics, and operational research.

- `/scripts`  
  SAS/SQL scripts implementing ETL pipeline automation, model building (GBM, clustering, regression), and analytics workflows.

- `/reports`  
  BI dashboards, summary reports, and visualizations (SAS VA) for institutional and academic decision support.

## About

Each project demonstrates proficiency in data mining, model building, and results communication—using SAS as the core analytics engine for academic and research decision support.
